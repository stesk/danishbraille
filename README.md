# Danish braille
## Terminology
The basic translation encompasses grade 1 or uncontracted braille. Contracted braille, or "stor forkortelse" in Danish, is termed grade 2, as per international standards. The level of contraction known as "lille forkortelse" in Danish is here regarded as partial grade 2 because it is a subset of "stor forkortelse".
